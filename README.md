# bind-predict-ML
## This project is part of the UniProt machine learning challenge
### The main objective of the challenge is to use machine learning to predict the binding sites for metal ions in proteome.
In this repo, I have explored the datasets provided by UniProt in detials. I have also noted down many findings in both notebooks annotated by version 1 and version 2.

Both versions contain detailed description of every stage.

However, all the cleaning and data wrangling happening in both notebooks have leaded to a database construction that will be used for Deep Learning prediction pipeline construction.
